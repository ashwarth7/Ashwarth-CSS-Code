  <p style="color: gold;background-color: black;">  A paragraph is a brief piece of writing that's around seven to ten sentences long. 
    It has a topic sentence and supporting sentences that all relate closely to the topic sentence.
     The paragraph form refers to its overall structure, which is a group of sentences focusing on a single topic.

<p style="color: #07f813;background-color: rgb(255, 8, 0);"> Space is the vast, nearly empty expanse surrounding our planet, extending far beyond Earth's atmosphere. 
  It's a vacuum with extremely low pressure where sound cannot travel due to the lack of air molecules to transmit vibrations.
   While often thought of as completely empty, space actually contains gas, dust, and other matter, including stars, planets, and galaxies.
