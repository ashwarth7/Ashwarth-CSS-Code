 <p>Friendship is a selfless bond between two people. Having a friend you can trust with eyes closed is God's blessing.
     Friendship is a devoted relation, where both get the same love, care, and priority from each other.
     At an early age, people come in contact with various members of the public, and they make many friends.
    </p> 

<p>A best friend is a treasure to be cherished, someone who understands you better than anyone else.
     They are there for you in moments of joy, offering a shoulder to lean on when times are tough, and always ready to celebrate your successes. 
     They are the ones who know your quirks, your secrets, and your deepest desires, yet still love and accept you unconditionally.
      A best friend is more than just someone to hang out with; they're a confidante, a partner in crime, and a source of endless support and laughter.
     Their presence enriches your life, making it a more vibrant and fulfilling journey.
    </p>
